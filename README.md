# Movie Trailer Website

This is a program, written in Python, which creates a web page to display some of my favorite movies. The web page displays tiles of various movies, which include the movie poster, the movie title, and the year the movie was released. When you click on a tile, the movie trailer will play.

## Files

The program includes three files:

* media.py - inludes the class definition which defines the movie information that will be stored
* entertainment_center.py - includes the instances of the individual movies
* fresh_tomatoes.py - includes the code which generates the actual HTML page

## How to make it work

1. Clone the repository with the following command: `git clone https://github.com/colecode-ph/movie-website.git`
2. Once you have the files on your local machine, change to the directory where the files are located.
3. Then run the program with the following command: `python entertainment_center.py`
